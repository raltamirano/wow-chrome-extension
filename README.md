====================

Web Open With (WOW) Chrome extension provides you configurable contextual menu items on hyperlinks and selected text to pass the target item to another site.

CREDITS: The WOW icons were found at http://www.gettyicons.com/free-icon/120/hydro-pro-icon-set/free-wow-icon-png/, and the author of that set of beautiful icons is Media Design (Website: http://mediadesign.deviantart.com) - my kudos for such a great artwork!
